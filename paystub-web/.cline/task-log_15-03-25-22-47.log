GOAL: Troubleshoot a "screwed up" UI issue reported by the user when running the application locally.

IMPLMENTATION: Inspected `index.html`, `src/index.css`, `src/App.css`, and `tailwind.config.js` to understand the styling and identify potential conflicts or misconfigurations. Identified the neumorphic styling as a likely cause and examined its color definitions in the Tailwind configuration.
