GOAL: Database screen should be sorted by individual and pay statements grouped by individuals.
IMPLEMENTATION: 
- In DatabasePage.js, individuals fetched via getIndividuals were sorted by name and used to create a mapping for grouping pay statements.
- Pay statements were grouped by individual using the mapped individual names, and each group was sorted by date (newest first, with “Unknown_Date” handled appropriately).
- In DataTable.js, a useEffect hook was added to automatically expand all groups when grouped data is provided, ensuring that pay statements remain grouped by individual.
